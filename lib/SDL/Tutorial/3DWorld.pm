=head1 NAME

SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld - Create a 3D world from scratch with SDL and OpenGL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tutorial is intended to demonstrate the creation of a trivial but
relatively usable "3D Game Engine".

The demonstration code provided implements the four main elements of a
basic three-dimensional game world.

=over

=item *

A static landscape in which events will occur.

=item *

A light source to illuminate the world.

=item *

A collection of N objects which move around independantly inside the
world.

=item *

A user-controlled mobile camera through which the world is viewed

=back

Each element of the game world is encapsulated inside a standalone class.

This lets you see which parts of the Open GL operations are used to work
with each element of the game world, and provides a starting point from
which you can start to make your own simple game-specific engines.

The C<new> constructor sets up the model for the 3D World, but does not
initiate or start the game itself.

It does not current take any parameters.

The C<camera> method returns the currently active camera for the world.

Provided as a convenience for world objects that need to know where the
camera is (such as the skybox).

The C<sdl> method returns the master L<SDLx::App> object for the world.
