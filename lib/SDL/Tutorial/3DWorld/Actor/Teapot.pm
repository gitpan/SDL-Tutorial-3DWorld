=head1 NAME

SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor::Teapot - A moving teapot within the game world

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Create a vertical stack of teapots
  my @stack = ();
  foreach my $height ( 1 .. 10 ) {
      push @stack, SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor::Teapot->new(
          X => 0,
          Y => $height * 0.30, # Each teapot is 30cm high
          Z => 0,
      );
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor::Teapot is a little teapot, short and stout.

It is drawn with the GLUT C<glutCreateTeapot> function.

class L<SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor>.

=head2 new

  # I want to be a little teapot, short and stout (and the default colour)
  my $teapot = SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor::Teapot->new(
      size => 0.15, # 15cm
  );

In additional to the regular material properties provided by the parent
L<SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor> class teapots take an additional C<size>
parameter to control how big the teapot is.

Teapots are 20cm high by default (because tea is best with friends and so
we'll need to brew several cups).

	my $class = shift;
	my $self  = $class->SUPER::new(
		@_,
	);

	# By default teapots are about 20cm in size (I'm making this up)
	$self->{size} = 0.20;

	return $self;
}
