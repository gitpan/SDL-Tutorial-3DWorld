=head1 NAME

SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor - A moving object within the game world

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Create a vertical stack of teapots
  my @stack = ();
  foreach my $height ( 1 .. 10 ) {
      push @stack, SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor->new(
          X => 0,
          Y => $height * 0.30, # Each teapot is 30cm high
          Z => 0,
      );
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Within the game, the term "Actor" is used to describe anything that has
a shape and moves around the world based on it's own set of rules.

In practice, an actor could be anything from a bullet or a grenade flying
through the air, to a fully articulated roaring dragon with flaming breath
and it's own artificial intelligence.

To the game engine, all of these "actors" are basically the same. They are
merely things that need to describe where they are and what they look like
each time the engine wants to render a frame.

In this demonstration, the default actor is a 30cm x 30cm teapot. We are
using a teapot because it is the "official" test mesh object for OpenGL
and is built directly into the library itself via the C<glutCreateTeapot>
function.

=head1 METHODS

use strict;
use warnings;
use OpenGL;

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head2 new

  my $teapot = SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Actor->new;

The C<new> constructor is used to create a new actor within the 3D World.

In the demonstration implementation, the default actor consists of a teapot.

=cut

sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	my $self  = bless { @_ }, $class;

	# Default location is at the origin
	$self->{X} ||= 0;
	$self->{Y} ||= 0;
	$self->{Z} ||= 0;

	return $self;
}

=pod

=head2 X

The C<X> accessor provides the location of the actor in metres on the east
to west dimension within the 3D world. The positive direction is east.

=cut

sub X {
	$_[0]->{X};
}

=pod

=head2 Y

The C<Y> accessor is location of the actor in metres on the vertical
dimension within the 3D world. The positive direction is up.

=cut

sub Y {
	$_[0]->{Y};
}

=pod

=head2 Z

The C<Z> accessor provides the actor of the camera in metres on the north
to south dimension within the 3D world. The positive direction is north.

=cut

sub Z {
	$_[0]->{Z};
}
