=head1 NAME

SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Texture - A texture API simple enough for mere mortals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Create the texture object (validating only the file exists)
  my $texture = SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Texture->new( file => $file );
  
  # Load the texture into memory, ready for use in your program
  $texture->init;
  
  # Make this texture the active OpenGL texture for drawing
  $texture->display;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OpenGL textures are a large and complex topic, with a steep learning curve.

Most tutorials on texturing demonstrate a single specific use case, and
often implement their own image loaders in the process. Unlike most other
basic topics in OpenGL, texturing examples are difficult to translate into
working code for your own program (and even then the amount of code can
be rather large and crufty).

This module provides a convenient abstraction that streamlines the most
obvious case of reading an image file from disk, binding it to the OpenGL
environment, and then activating the texture so you can paint it onto
something.

  # Load a texture from a shared file texture collection
  my $chess = SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Texture->new(
      file => File::Spec->catfile(
          File::ShareDir::dist_dir('SDL-Tutorial-3DWorld'),
          'textures',
          'chessboard.png',
      ),
  );

The C<new> constructor creates a new texture handle which identifies a
texture to be loaded from disk.

It takes a single named C<file> parameter which should be the path to
the texture on disk. While the C<new> constructor will validate that the
file exists, it will not attempt to load the image. Any image files that
are broken, corrupt or unsupported will not be identified until C<init>
is called.

sub new {
	my $class = shift;
	my $self  = bless { @_ }, $class;

	# Check the file
	unless ( -f $self->file ) {
		die "Texture file '" . $self->file . "' does not exist";
	}

	return $self;
}

=head2 file

The C<file> accessor returns the path to the file the texture was
originally loaded from.
