=head1 NAME

SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Skybox - Better than a uniform sky colour

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Skybox is a common method for drawing a full photographic background
for a 3D World visible in all directions.

It consists of a large cube with a set of six special pre-rendered
textures that stich together at the edges, creating the appearance of
a large surrounding environment.

For more information on the general concept of a sky box see
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_%28video_games%29>.

This basic implementation takes a directory and looks for six image files
within it called F<north.bmp>, F<south.bmp>, F<east.bmp>, F<west.bmp>,
F<up.bmp> and F<down.bmp>.

The textures are projected onto the cube and uniformly lit, ignoring the
normal lighting model.

The main special effects "trick" to implementing a skybox is that it will
rotate with the rest of the world but match the movements of the camera
so that artifacts in the skybox texture stay the same size regardless of
the movement of the camera (making them appear to be a long way away).

  # Load a skybox from a set of files included within a distribution
  my $sky = SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Skybox->new(
      directory => File::Spec->catdir(
          File::ShareDir::dist_dir('SDL-Tutorial-3DWorld'), 'skybox'
      )
  );

The C<new> constructor creates a new skybox object.

It takes a single C<directory> parameter which should be a directory that
exists, and contains the six named BMP skybox texture files.

Although the existance of the texture files will be checked at constructor
time, they will not actually be loaded until you run the world (during the
init phase).

=head2 type

The C<type> accessor returns the file type of the skybox textures.
