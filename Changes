Changes for Perl extension SDL-Tutorial-3DWorld

0.07 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Like all good games, 3DWorld now runs full screen

0.06 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- The landscape is now a 10x10 metre chess board
	- A new "at the origin" event filter for removing warp_mouse events,
	  as the first "ignore next" one didn't account for event queueing
	  and stuttering was starting to occur.
	- Moved the light to approximately the location of where the sun is
	  on the skybox for added "realism"
	- All actors now have a velocity vector.
	- Slightly less sucky material for the teapots.
	- The teapots slowly fly away in the positive X, Y and Z directions

0.05 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Skybox is now both optional and actually works

0.04 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Adding a texture abstraction library
	- Adding a simple implementation of a skybox

0.03 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Do not show the mouse cursor
	- Capture the mouse cursor to allow infinite mouselook travel
	- Adding a trivial constructor test (that doesn't init OpenGL)
	- Adding Test::NoWarnings to the tests

0.02 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Fixed the lighting and material of the objects

0.01 Tue 14 Dec 2010
