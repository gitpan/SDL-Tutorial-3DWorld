Changes for Perl extension SDL-Tutorial-3DWorld

0.20 Mon 20 Dec 2010
	- Apparently OpenGL convention dictates that all polygons have their
	  points declared counter-clockwise to the "front" of the polygon.
	  Once turning on face culling to save GL work, it turns out that
	  all my shapes would inside out. Oops :)
	- Importing a local fork of OpenGL::RWX
	- Adding a life-sized nutcracker doll to help test RWX support.
	- Expanded OpenGL::RWX's per-face surface normals to face-averaged
	  per-vertex surface normals, allowing OpenGL to currectly smooth the
	  polygons (important on polished wood toys)
	- Added preliminary support for OBJ models (only with per-face surface
	  normals at this point).
	- Added a superbly details and giant freaking table to demonstrate the
	  greater quality of objects you tend to be able to find for obj files.

0.19 Mon 20 Dec 2010
	- Added a "God Mode" flying camera which uses the left shift key
	  as an exponential speed accelerator, and make it the default.
	- Added ->current static method to ::3DWorld to get currently
	  world. Removes the need to pass things like the camera around
	  everywhere all the time.
	- The skybox now locates the camera via ->current->camera instead
	  having to be passed the camera.
	- Added a console for overlaying the world with diagnostic text.
	- Set min_t to zero to push frames per second as high as possible.
	- Correcting some broken versions

0.18 Sun 19 Dec 2010
	- Moving the landscape to a typical 2000-era infinite ground plane,
	  but with a more detailed texture than in that era.
	  Unfortunately, the new ground plane means our skybox looks wrong
	  now, as it was never designed for use with a ground plane.
	- Reorganised some internals so we don't need to export from OpenGL
	  so much. This will be removed later, once OpenGL fixes it constants.
	- Added support for tiling textures with SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld::Tile

0.17 Sat 18 Dec 2010
	- Added preliminary support for loading models from RWX files

0.16 Sat 18 Dec 2010
	- Switch from manual GL display list code to OpenGL::List
	- Implemented left shift for "running"

0.15 Fri 17 Dec 2010
	- Because we can be fairly certain that TextureCube (i.e. crates)
	  will be popular, use that class to demonstrate the use of OpenGL
	  display lists via glGenLists(), glNewList(), and glCallList().
	- Noting that, of all things, glLineWidth() is insanely expensive.

0.14 Fri 17 Dec 2010
	- Actors are now rendered in random order to expose any places
	  where material property state management is being done badly.
	- Added some simple utility methods for getting paths to files
	  and directories in the share directory.
	- Added a TextureCube package for creating floor-origin rotatable
	  resizable cubes with the same (and correctly oriented) texture
	  on each face. Which is to say...
	- Fear the mighty Crate! Weep! Swoon!

0.13 Fri 17 Dec 2010
	- Factored the teapot-specific logic into a separate class
	- Added a new "grid cube" actor which demonstrates points, lines,
	  multiple element actors and grid-snapping for worlds which
	  inherently consist of a cube space (think original Wolfenstein).
	- When a texture is displayed it now inherently defends itself
	  against being altered by previous alpha channel settings of
	  other objects.
	- The 3dworld launcher now supports a --window option to disable
	  fullscreen in places where it's weird (like on my giant portrait
	  orientation monitors at $work)

0.12 Fri 17 Dec 2010
	- Increase default (only) resolution to 1024x768
	- Turned on double buffering to prevent mouselook flicker

0.11 Fri 17 Dec 2010
	- OpenGL::GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR definitely looks better, especially
	  when it has text on it.
	- Change the skybox overlap to a minimum amount for slightly tighter
	  welding of the skybox edges.
	- Change to 24 bit colour depth so we don't get colour gradient steps

0.10 Fri 17 Dec 2010
	- The three teapots now match the official colours for the three axis
	- Adding direction label text to the chessboard image
	- Adding direction label text to all of the skybox image
	- The chessboard texture was upside down, corrected
	- The skybox images were backwards and inverted, corrected
	- Moved the "examples" (that weren't) into the private directory

0.09 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- The skybox cube faces now overlap just slightly, which removes the
	  visible tearing between each face.
	- Now the skybox doesn't suck, tweak the light position closer to
	  where the sun is on the skybox should the shading and reflection
	  look absolutely correct.

0.08 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Low-sophistication (Smooth Hinting) anti-aliasing enabled for all
	  three of points, lines and polygons.
	- Fixed the chessboard material so it works with blending enabled.
	- Add GL hinting to make the texture scaling prettier.
	- Movement is now done via the move callback, locking movement to real
	  world time and making it independant of render speeds.
	- Half-assed support for identifying speeds in real metres per second.
	- Fixed a stupid trig bug in the camera movement logic, walking no
	  longer makes you skew sideways like a drunken troll when facing east.

0.07 Thu 16 Dec 2010
	- Like all good games, 3DWorld now runs full screen

0.06 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- The landscape is now a 10x10 metre chess board
	- A new "at the origin" event filter for removing warp_mouse events,
	  as the first "ignore next" one didn't account for event queueing
	  and stuttering was starting to occur.
	- Moved the light to approximately the location of where the sun is
	  on the skybox for added "realism"
	- All actors now have a velocity vector.
	- Slightly less sucky material for the teapots.
	- The teapots slowly fly away in the positive X, Y and Z directions

0.05 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Skybox is now both optional and actually works

0.04 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Adding a texture abstraction library
	- Adding a simple implementation of a skybox

0.03 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Do not show the mouse cursor
	- Capture the mouse cursor to allow infinite mouselook travel
	- Adding a trivial constructor test (that doesn't init OpenGL)
	- Adding Test::NoWarnings to the tests

0.02 Wed 15 Dec 2010
	- Fixed the lighting and material of the objects

0.01 Tue 14 Dec 2010
	- Created the initial game model
