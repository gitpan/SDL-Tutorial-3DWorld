NAME
    SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld - Create a 3D world from scratch with SDL and
    OpenGL

DESCRIPTION
    This tutorial is intended to demonstrate the creation of a trivial but
    relatively usable "3D Game Engine".

    The demonstration code provided implements the four main elements of a
    basic three-dimensional game world.

    *   A static landscape in which events will occur.

    *   A light source to illuminate the world.

    *   A collection of N objects which move around independantly inside the
        world.

    *   A user-controlled mobile camera through which the world is viewed

    Each element of the game world is encapsulated inside a standalone
    class.

    This lets you see which parts of the Open GL operations are used to work
    with each element of the game world, and provides a starting point from
    which you can start to make your own simple game-specific engines.

METHODS
  new
    The "new" constructor sets up the model for the 3D World, but does not
    initiate or start the game itself.

    It does not current take any parameters.

  camera
    The "camera" method returns the currently active camera for the world.

    Provided as a convenience for world objects that need to know where the
    camera is (such as the skybox).

  sdl
    The "sdl" method returns the master SDLx::App object for the world.

  run
    The "run" method is used to run the game. It takes care of all stages of
    the game including initialisation and shutdown operations at the start
    and end of the game.

  current
    The "current" method can be used by any arbitrary world element to get
    access to the world while it is running.
