NAME
    SDL::Tutorial::3DWorld - Demonstrates a very basic 3D engine

DESCRIPTION
    This tutorial is intended to demonstrate the creation of a trivial but
    relatively usable "3D Game Engine".

    The demonstration code provided implements the four main elements of a
    basic three-dimensional game world.

    *   A static landscape in which events will occur.

    *   A light source to illuminate the world.

    *   A collection of N objects which move around independantly inside the
        world.

    *   A user-controlled mobile camera through which the world is viewed

    Each element of the game world is encapsulated inside a standalone
    class.

    This lets you see which parts of the Open GL operations are used to work
    with each element of the game world, and provides a starting point from
    which you can start to make your own simple game-specific engines.

METHODS
  new
    The "new" constructor sets up the model for the 3D World, but does not
    initiate or start the game itself.

    It does not current take any parameters.

  run
    The "run" method is used to run the game. It takes care of all stages of
    the game including initialisation and shutdown operations at the start
    and end of the game.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at
